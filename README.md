# SimpleEDA

This is a course project, aiming at building a simple EDA handling basic circuit simulation.

## How to build

This project uses [xmake](https://xmake.io/) to build, which has a very simple grammar and is easy to use.

## Future Improvement

The logic of parser is a pile of shit. To be replaced by grammar-tree-like logic.

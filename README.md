# SimpleEDA

This is a course project, aiming at building a simple EDA handling basic circuit simulation, with support of DC, AC and TRAN analysis for both linear and nonlinear devices.

## How to build

This project uses [xmake](https://xmake.io/) to build, which has a very simple grammar and is easy to use.

## Future Improvement

Use PEG(parsing expression grammars) to parse.
